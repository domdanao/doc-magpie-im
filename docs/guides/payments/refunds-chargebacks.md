# Refunds and Chargebacks

Managing refunds and chargebacks effectively is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and protecting your business. Magpie provides comprehensive tools and guidance to handle these situations professionally.

## Refunds

### How Refunds Work

When you process a refund through Magpie:
1. **Refund initiated** through your dashboard or API
2. **Customer notification** sent automatically
3. **Amount refunded** to customer's original payment method
4. **Platform fee retained** by Magpie
5. **Net refund amount** deducted from your next payout

### Processing Refunds

#### Through Dashboard
1. **Navigate to** Payments > Transactions
2. **Find the transaction** you want to refund
3. **Click "Refund"** button
4. **Enter refund amount** (partial or full)
5. **Add refund reason** for your records
6. **Confirm refund** processing

#### Through API
```javascript
// Example: Process full refund
POST /v2/charges/{charge_id}/refund
{
  "amount": 5000, // Optional: for partial refunds
  "reason": "customer_request"
}
```

## Chargebacks

### What is a Chargeback?

A chargeback occurs when a customer contacts their credit card company to dispute a charge, rather than contacting you directly for a refund. The bank then reverses the transaction and investigates the claim.

### Common Chargeback Reasons

- **Unauthorized use** of credit card
- **Identity theft** or stolen card
- **Account takeover** by fraudster

- **Delayed delivery** beyond expectations

#### üí∏ Billing Issues

**Challenge the Chargeback:**
- **Gather evidence** to dispute the claim
